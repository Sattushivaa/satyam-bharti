Surprisingly, I came in this field accidently.
yes! it's true. Actually I was in class 8th when it was lockdown and our studies were going on Online.
Our math teacher told us to create account on khan academy and practice maths assignments she gave.
I was fond of mobile since i was in class 3rd 😁, so surfing about the website, i encountered a programming course.
Until then, I thought programming was boring and actually I didn't know properly what it was, But don't know why, I gave it a try and found it was amazing.
From then, I and programming are best friends.
